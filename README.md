Here's a personal repository of many codes I write while doing coding challenges
or just studies I do about determined topic. Please, don't take it very seriously. 

Few things included here:

- Cracking the Coding Interview (directory named as *CTCI*)
- Programming Pearls problems
- Hacker Rank problems
- SPOJ problems
- TopCoder problems
- Code Katas
